- Don't disconnect irc client immediately, allow reconnecting after disconnect / page refresh
- Come up with solution to servers not refreshing until you visit another history result

  - Will keep a similar look to evergreen's native grid
- use custom status indicators on server list to show which ones are online (combine with all servers returned in search results)
