Fix / set up github actions automated builds

Handle name conflicts when connecting to IRC server.

Allow specifying download directory.
    Pass in via config options.
    Docker build will run the app with set directory
    If not present, default to downloads directory.

Each deploy should use separate name conventions or specify names from the args to avoid conflicts.


Variable platform docker image
Set up automatic github release deployments
Configure docker image to use custom name arguments from environment variables. If custom environment variable is not specified,
     generate a random username to avoid server deployment naming conflicts.


Only deploy to github actions when the tag version changes.

Add new config options:
    - dir (directory where book files will be persisted)
    - persist (enable persistance)


In the docker container:
    Set a "docker" environment variable
    Get get a persist flag from the username
    If persist is enabled and docker -> set directory to a special output directory so that users can mount the volume


    Set username to something like "default"
    If docker and username is "default" generate a random one
    Expose an evironment variable from docker that lets user set the username
