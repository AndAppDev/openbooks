- Show raw IRC logs in web interface
- Update screenshots in readme
- Don't disconnect irc client immediately, allow reconnecting after disconnect / page refresh
- Come up with solution to servers not refreshing until you visit another history result
- use react grid instead of evergreen grid. it is easier to style and manage
  - Will keep a similar look to evergreen's native grid
- use custom status indicators on server list to show which ones are online (combine with all servers returned in search results)

  - web interface -> via websocket
  - DONE: cli -> via progress bar
