✔ Files should be saved to the user's download directory @done(19-05-17 17:58)

    The user never sees this because the inner file is extracted and the zip deleted
    Probably has something to do with regex but I cannot figure it out. In tests
      it is working fine...
  ✔ Download Book Files are surrounded with double quotes ("") @done(19-05-17 17:58)
    The regular expression had to be updated to account for strings that may or
      may not contain quotes.
