Visual Studio Code users can make use of the [dev-container](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/develop-cloud/containers). Using the development container makes it easy to get started as all the application's development dependencies are included.

Upon opening the project folder in VSCode you will be prompted to select whether or not to open the project in the dev container.
